## Solving an exercise

### Step 1
To provide a solution to tasks in an exercise, fork this repository, clone your fork, create a subdirectory with the exercise code and your GitHub username in the solutions directory, in this format: `solutions/<exercise code>/<your github username>`.

Example: [./solutions/B1A/dystopiandev](./solutions/B1A/dystopiandev)

### Step 2
Implement your solution in that directory, and take care to exclude files that aren't meant to be included in your commit.

### Step 3
Create a Pull Request to the `main` branch of this repository. That's it.
